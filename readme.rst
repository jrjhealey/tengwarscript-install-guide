What's Tengwar?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Tengwar comprise an alphabet invented by J.R.R. Tolkien
for writing Quenya or Sindarin (Elvish) in his writings
such as Lord of the Rings.
It can be used for other languages, too, `including English`_.

This is a guide for getting started producing Tengwar
with the LaTeX typesetting system.
It will use the `TengwarScript`_ package.
TengwarScript does not use Tengwar characters directly,
since Tengwar `has not yet been standardized into Unicode`_.
Instead, it uses custom fonts.
The fonts are not included in the TengwarScript package,
presumably because the legal status of the fonts is not clear.
The guide includes a `companion script`_
to automate the downloading, installing, and configuring of the fonts,
most of which are TrueType fonts.

There `are`_ `other`_ `methods`_ for writing Tengwar with TeX,
`including XeTeX`_, but they will not be used in this guide.
This will focus on producing PDFs.
Look elsewhere for writing with Tengwar `on the web`_.

This guide was tested on Debian unstable with TeX Live 2013,
but it should be applicable to most LaTeX installs.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Quickstart guide to using Tengwar fonts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

------------
Installation
------------

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Option 1: Run the `install script`_.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It is a bash script and requires that ``curl`` and ``unzip`` are installed.

If you are doing this for the first time,
the script will download all the fonts into your ``~/texmf/`` directory.
If you have downloaded these fonts before and the directory names are the same,
existing files that are older than the new files will be overwritten.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Option 2: Do the same steps as the install script, but manually.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. Ensure you have the `TengwarScript`_ package installed.

   For example, run ``kpsewhich tengwarscript.sty``.
   If you get an output such as::
   
       $ kpsewhich tengwarscript.sty
       /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex/tengwarscript/tengwarscript.sty
   
   then you are fine. If you get a blank, then you need to install it.
   It is on `CTAN`_ and packaged in most Linux distributions.
   On Debian, it is in `texlive-fonts-extra`_.

#. Run ``updmap --enable Map=tengwarscript.map``.

   If you do not run this command,
   you must `add this line to every Tex file`_ that uses Tengwar fonts::

       \pdfmapfile{=tengwarscript.map}

   Some tutorials recommend running ``mktexlsr``
   or ``texhash`` on ``~/texmf`` at this point. This is unnecessary.

#. Make the directory ``~/texmf/fonts/truetype/``.

   This is in your local ``texmf`` `directory`_,
   so you don't need administrator privileges.
   If you're not sure where ``texmf`` is, run this command::

       $ kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFHOME

#. Download the Tengwar fonts you want and unzip them there.

.. _install script: ./install-tengwar-scripts.sh
.. _add this line to every Tex file: http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/56487/tengwar-script-in-tex-live
.. _CTAN: http://www.ctan.org/pkg/tengwarscript
.. _texlive-fonts-extra: https://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=names&keywords=texlive-fonts-extra
.. _directory: https://vajrabhrt.wordpress.com/2009/04/01/your-home-texmf-tree/

--------------
Testing it out
--------------

After performing option 1 or 2,
compile this document in your favorite LaTeX editor::

    \documentclass{minimal}
    \usepackage[all]{tengwarscript}
    \begin{document}
    \Tquesse\TTacute\Ttinco\TTdoubler\TTthreedots
    \end{document}

This will use the default Parmaite font
to write the Tengwar word *quetta*, meaning *word*.
(This is an example from the tengwarscript documentation.)

Once you have a working installation,
you can try more `interesting examples`_.

For convenient Roman to Tengwar transcription,
you will probably want to use a conversion script,
such as the `Perl tengwar transcriber`_.

.. _interesting examples: http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/13015/what-package-allows-elvish-in-tex
.. _Perl tengwar transcriber: http://djelibeibi.unex.es/tengwar/#transcription

---------------
Troubleshooting
---------------

If you get errors such as this::

    !pdfTeX error: pdflatex (file Parmaite.ttf): cannot open TrueType font file for reading

try changing the font::

    \documentclass{minimal}
    \usepackage[annatar]{tengwarscript}
    \begin{document}
    \Tquesse\TTacute\Ttinco\TTdoubler\TTthreedots
    \end{document}

or try explicitly adding the map file::

    \documentclass{minimal}
    \pdfmapfile{=tengwarscript.map}
    \usepackage[annatar]{tengwarscript}
    \begin{document}
    \Tquesse\TTacute\Ttinco\TTdoubler\TTthreedots
    \end{document}

Make sure the names of the fonts match the names in ``tengwarscript.map``.

On Debian, this file is here::

    /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/fonts/map/dvips/tengwarscript/tengwarscript.map

You will need to do a lot of renaming of the ``.ttf`` files
if you take the manual route (Option 2).

Note: the ``tengtest.tex`` file in the documentation
requires the ``texlive-lang-spanish`` Debian package.

Provenance status of Tengwar fonts for LaTeX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The TengwarScript package was updated to v1.3.1 in 2014,
and it now points to archived URL for the fonts
since many of the original websites have been taken down.
However, all of the founts can be found with some searching.

Yahoo took down Geocities (410 Gone).

There is an Internet Archive of the page, but not the font packs.

Fortunately, third parties have preserved Geocities,
although they don't allow crawling so the Internet Archive won't preserve them.
